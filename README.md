 React Native Firebase

This is a React Native Firebase Starter Project with login, registration, persisted login, database reads and writes. You can use this project as boilerplate for bootstrapping any new React Native app that uses Firebase as its backend.

This React Native Firebase starter contains a few key features that all apps backed by Fireabase support:

* Registration with E-mail & Password
* Login with E-mail and Password
* Handling persisted login credentials
* Navigation (react-native-navigation)
* Writing to Firestore Database
* Reading from Firestore Database
* Creating Firestore indices (for performance)

## Getting Started (with Expo)

cd react-native-firebase

npx expo start
